Programming Fundamentals
Programming is creating instructions for computers to follow.
Variables store data values, e.g., int age = 25;.
Data Types define the kind of data, like integers and strings.
Control Structures manage program flow with constructs like if statements and loops.
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform tasks.
